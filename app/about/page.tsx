                <p className="mb-4">
                    We believe that widespread dependence on algorithm-driven social media is harming our wellbeing and eroding our ability to meaningfully connect with the world around us.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Our aim is simply to <span className="font-bold">help people</span> by reducing that dependency through intentional choice and solidarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pledge at the center of this project is voluntary and self-directed. We hope you&apos;ll join us in working toward a culture where we spend our most valuable resource (our time) in the real world, rather than the digital one.

                        Disconnect Society was founded by one person in Madison, WI. It is not funded by investors. It is not a political organization. It is not affiliated with any technology company or competitor. It is not selling a product.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        I started this project because I noticed changes in myself that I didn&apos;t like, and I <span className="italic">knew</span> those changes were directly connected to how I spent my time online. I felt more isolated than ever, more anxious, more depressed, and angrier. I was losing hours of my life to content that I wouldn&apos;t remember later that day, finding it harder to focus on one thing at a time, and getting less satisfaction from activities I used to love.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">For several years I listened to the people in my life voice similar concerns, and I finally decided the price I was paying for dopamine on social media was too high. I started deleting accounts one at a time and found I didn&apos;t miss them, and in 2025 I finally deleted my last social media account. <span className="font-bold">I haven&apos;t looked back</span>.</p>
                    <p>
                        With every account I deleted, I reclaimed a little bit more of myself. I read more and slept better. I started talking to the people who live and work in my neighborhood. I became more present and intentional. My hope is this project will help other people improve their mental wellbeing, and know they aren&apos;t alone in the pursuit.
